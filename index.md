## About me
cascading style sheets are now the standard way to define the presentation of your HTML pages, from fonts and colours to the complete layout of a page. They are much more efficient than using HTML on every page to define the look of your site.

CSS is becoming a more important language to know every day, so the sooner you have a grip on this most elegant of presentational languages, the better.
